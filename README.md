### Experience

#### Trainee Web Developer | [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/)

March 2018 - July 2018

Here I learned software development with a focus on test-driven development. I learned how to break down and solve problems using best coding practices.

My experience simulated working in a real developer team where we implemented an agile way of working, as well as working independently. Part of the course focuses on emotional intelligence which is crucial to have when working in a team; being able to understand how to help others around you.

#### Technology Club Manager | [MakerClub](http://makerclub.org/)
June 2016 - December 2017    

MakerClub teaches robotics, programming, design and 3D printing to children 7-16. As Technology Club Manager, I contributed to the nationwide curriculum, liaised with corporate clients and ran the online customer service system allowing me to experience many sides of the business.

I ran coding and robotics workshops at the following events: Institude of Imagination, Ernst & Young, WIRED's Next Generation and Barclays Code Playground.

#### Digital Skills Trainer | [Freeformers](https://freeformers.com/)
April 2016 - April 2017   

As a Digital Skills Trainer I delivered engaging presentations to large companies on the following content:

APIs, Servers and Data Centres, App prototyping and invention, Cyber Security, Agile methodologies.

I managed both corporate training days and coding workshops at digital skills festivals, such as [Upload Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkD0f-tos8), for young people.
