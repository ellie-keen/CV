In training to become a Full Stack Developer at Europe's leading Software Development bootcamp, [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com/).

For as long as I can remember I've been glued to computers. This interest has taken me from managing technology clubs for youngsters, to teaching corporate bankers how to create web applications. 

My need for a  balance of logic and creativity is what has led me to pursuing a career as a software developer. 

Short sentence about what I've achieved with Makers and what environment I'd like to work in*

## Skills

#### Leadership

As Technology Club Manager at MakerClub, my role entailed leading a small team of staff and volunteers. I was responsible for the hiring, training and onboarding proccess of my team.

I contributed to the curriculum taught within the clubs and was often asked to deliver my ideas to other Club Managers nationwide. This gave me the opportunity to exemplify how workshops should be delivered and how to adhere to the brand.

Prior to working in technology, I worked in hospitality as a Supervisor at Bournemouth's busiest Wetherspoon establishment. I would manage a team of up to 10 people per shift. This involved delegating tasks, managing customer's needs and reporting back to senior management on issues such as inventory.

#### Communication

* *Use example from time at Makers* (Pair programming, team projects)

My previous roles have often required me to present and engage audiences. This is where I developed the skill of public speaking. I was once asked to speak at an assembly at a local college about Rapid Prototyping. This encounter led to a business deal where I guided college students through a 10 week employability project. This ended with amazing results, where the college I was mentoring won the [Aspirations Academies Portfolio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GylvEmoT8ko) against competing colleges.
