As a graduate of Europe's leading Software Development bootcamp, Makers Academy, I am seeking opportunities in London as a Junior Full-Stack Developer. 

I previously spent two years setting up code and technology clubs for youngsters and running workshops in app creation and digital skills for corporate clients.

I am now looking for a work environment where I can keep growing my knowledge of programming and continue having fun doing what I love, crafting creative projects with other like-minded engineers.

#### Experience

#### Student | [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/)

March 2018 - July 2018

I am a graduate of the intensive developer bootcamp where I learned object-oriented programming with a focus on test-driven development. I learned how to break down and solve problems using best coding practices.

My experience simulated working in a real dev team where we implemented an agile way of working, as well as working independently. A large part of the course focuses on emotional intelligence which is crucial to have when working in a team; being able to understand how to help others around you, as well as maintaing self-care to avoid burnout.

June 2016 - December 2017    

I introduced MakerClub sessions within Bournemouth's community where I taught robotics, programming, design and 3D printing to children 7-16. I contributed to the nationwide curriculum, liaised with corporate clients and ran the online customer service system allowing me to experience many sides of the business.

I ran coding and robotics workshops at the following events: Institude of Imagination, Ernst & Young, WIRED's Next Generation and Barclays Code Playground.

#### Digital Skills Trainer | [Freeformers](https://freeformers.com/)
April 2016 - April 2017
